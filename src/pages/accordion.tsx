                    <p className={style.accordion_paragraph}>It is not recommended to use <em>Transitions Drivewear</em> lenses at night. <em>Drivewear </em>lenses are optimized for day light situation, and since <em>Transitions Drivewear</em> is always tinted, (min category 2, max category 3), it can be too dark to wear after dusk. Many Vision &amp; Highway Safety experts believe that NO tint should ever be used at night.</p>
